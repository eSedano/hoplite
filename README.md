Welcome to HOPLITE.

  This code is part of the work developed by me, Enrique Sedano, for the PhD "Automated word-length
optimization framework for multi-source statistical interval-based analysis of nonlinear systems
with control-flow structures".

  As it is currently, the code misses functionalities and contains (unknowns) bugs. For any question
regarding the usage and functioning of HOPLITE, please contact me at enrique@esedano.es. I will be
happy to know about your experience with the code, and the possible improvements you may find.

  I reserve the right to decide on any future modification and/or extension of the framework, as
as well as to modify it, including its main functionalities and API, without previous notice.

  To see an initial help on the available commands, type

$> hoplite.py --help

on your command line. I hope this engine is useful to you. Now go on and have fun.
